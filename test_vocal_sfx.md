# The Audition

## Scene 1: The Waiting Room

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. Mark sat in the plastic chair, bouncing his leg nervously.

He took a deep breath and sighed heavily.

"Next!" the casting director called out.

Mark stood up, smoothing his shirt. He walked into the audition room.

## Scene 2: The Performance

"State your name and scene," the director said, not looking up from his clipboard.

"Mark Evans. Scene 4."

"Go ahead."

Mark closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them, he was someone else.

"I can't believe you did this," he whispered, his voice trembling.

He began to cry, soft sobs at first, then growing louder. "After everything we've been through!"

Suddenly, he stopped. He wiped his eyes and started laughing. It was a cold, manic laugh that echoed in the empty room.

"You actually thought I cared?" he sneered.

The director looked up, impressed. "Okay, now give me fear."

Mark gasped sharply. He backed away, staring at an invisible horror. "No... stay back!"

He screamed, a terrifying, blood-curdling shriek.

## Scene 3: The Aftermath

"Thank you, Mark. We'll be in touch."

Mark relaxed instantly. "Thanks."

He walked out of the room. As the door closed behind him, he let out a long breath of relief.

"Nailed it," he chuckled to himself.
