# A Madison Square Arabian Night
## by O. Henry (Excerpt)

To Carson Chalmers, in his apartment near the square, Phillips brought the evening mail. Besides the routine correspondence there was a letter from the West written on a typewriter.

"A letter from her!" said Chalmers, starting.

"From the lady?" said Phillips. "This is the first time you have received a letter from her in more than a month."

"Yes," said Chalmers. "I'll read it while you wait for an answer."

Dear Carson:

I've got to tell you something. It's about Barbara and Gilbert Warren. Something has happened, and I've got to help fix it up. You see, it's like this: Gilbert sent Barbara a note asking her to come to his studio at twelve o'clock tonight. Barbara showed it to me, and I went instead. That sounds bad, but I'm going to explain.

Barbara is afraid of scandal. She's so proud that she'd die if people talked about her meeting a man at his studio so late at night. But she loves Gilbert and wants to marry him. I've just got to straighten this thing out somehow.

I know what you'll say—that I ought not to be mixing up in her affairs. But I'm fond of Bar, and besides, I'm sort of interested in Gilbert myself, for brotherly reasons only. He's a good fellow, but he's got himself into some kind of mix-up.

When I got to the studio, Gilbert was there alone working on a painting. He seemed surprised to see me instead of Barbara. I said Barbara sent me. That was a lie, but I had to tell it. Gilbert said his note wasn't meant for Barbara at all—it was for me! He had addressed it wrong.

Then he told me the whole story. He loves Barbara, but he thought she was too high-toned for him. He was afraid to ask her to marry him. So he decided to get me to help him. His plan was to ask me to the studio to paint my portrait—that would give him a good excuse to be alone with me. Then he was going to ask me to use my influence with Barbara to help him win her.

Pretty complicated, isn't it? But that's how artists think. They make everything twice as hard as it needs to be.

Well, I told him straight out that Barbara was crazy about him and had been for months. You should have seen his face! He went white as a sheet, then red as a beet. Then he grabbed his hat and coat and said he was going straight to Barbara's house to propose.

I tried to stop him. It was nearly one o'clock in the morning! But he wouldn't listen. He said he'd climb up the fire escape if necessary. That man was determined.

I hope everything worked out all right. I stayed at the studio until he came back. He was grinning from ear to ear. Barbara had accepted him! They're going to get married next month.

So that's the whole story. I thought you ought to know, seeing as how you're Barbara's cousin and all. I hope you don't mind that I stuck my nose into it. But somebody had to do something.

Your friend,
Nevada

Chalmers let the letter fall to his lap. He sat quite still for a moment, looking out the window at the lights of Madison Square.

"Phillips," he said at last, "I need to send a telegram. Please bring me a form."

Phillips brought the telegraph blank. Chalmers wrote rapidly:

"Nevada Warren, The Holbrook, Denver, Colorado: Delighted at news. You did exactly right. Family approves thoroughly. Uncle Jerome sends congratulations. When is the wedding? Carson."

He handed it to Phillips. "Send that at once, please."

As the servant left the room, Chalmers picked up the letter and read it through again, slowly. A smile played about his lips.

"Dear little Nevada," he said softly. "Always fixing things. Always making people happy. And she doesn't even know that Gilbert Warren is my best friend's brother, and I've been hoping all along that he'd marry Barbara."

He folded the letter carefully and put it in his pocket. Then he walked to the window and looked out at the snow beginning to fall over Madison Square.

"Six squares in a snow-storm," he mused. "That's Nevada for you. She came all the way from Arizona last year—traveled three thousand miles to be with Barbara. And tonight she walks six squares through a blizzard to help arrange a wedding. That's the kind of friend she is."

He turned from the window and rang for Phillips again.

"I've changed my mind about the telegram," he said when the servant appeared. "I'm going to the Holbrook myself. Please pack a bag for three days, and order a taxi."

"To Denver, sir?" asked Phillips in surprise.

"To Denver," said Chalmers firmly. "I should be there for the wedding. Besides, I have something important to discuss with Nevada."

As he spoke, he took from his desk a small velvet box. Inside was a ring—a simple gold band with a single diamond.

"I've been carrying this around for six months," he said to himself. "Waiting for the right time. Well, if Nevada can walk through a snow-storm to help her friend find happiness, I guess I can take a train to Denver to ask for my own."

He closed the box with a snap and put it in his vest pocket, over his heart.

Outside, the snow fell faster, covering Madison Square in a blanket of white. But Carson Chalmers didn't notice. He was already thinking about the mountains of Colorado, and a girl with wind-blown hair and honest eyes who fixed other people's problems and never thought twice about her own happiness.

"Nevada," he said again, smiling. "Dear little Nevada."
